<!-- about -->
<div class="prize_block section sTop">
    <p>The Sovereign Asian Art Prize was initiated in 2003 when the Sovereign Art Foundation was established as a charity in Hong Kong.
        All finalists will be posted on our website giving works a wider audience. The prestigious first prize of US$30,000 cash will be announced at the start of the finalists' exhibition. The "Schoeni Prize" is named in memory of our advisor and friend Manfred Schoeni who sadly passed away in 2004. This prize is decided solely by public votes cast at the exhibition and through the Sovereign Art Foundation website. The prize carries a nominal award of US$1,000.</p>
    <p>After the exhibition the works, other than the first prize which becomes the property of the Foundation, will be auctioned off by Christie's at a charity dinner. 50% of the proceeds of each sale go to the artist and the other 50% goes to the Foundation to be applied to its charitable work.</p>
    <p>As a larger number of artists become aware of this prestigious prize, we look forward to receiving even more entries and raising additional funds this year. As well as raising funds to assist art projects in Asia, The Sovereign Art Prize strives to recognise the most innovative and influential artists of our time.</p>
